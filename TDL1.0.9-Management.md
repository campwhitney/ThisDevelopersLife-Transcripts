# This Developer's Life 1.0.9: Management

Rob: Hey everyone, this is Rob. Thank you so much for listening to This Developer’s Life. Running this podcast, well, it costs a little bit of money for us, and so that’s why we need sponsorship. And Scott and I want to thank the following people. 
Number one of course is Twilio. If you need voice or SMS capabilities for your application, go check out Twilio at [Twilio.com](http://www.twilio.com/). T-w-i-l-i-o.com. We also have a new sponsor this week. It is SublimeSVN. Go check them out at [SublimeSVN.com](http://www.sublimesvn.com/). It’s a Subversion server built for Windows. It comes with a full-blown web interface. It allows you to do all kinds of cool stuff like automatically back up your repository, email, RSS, user configuration, has templates for your repository. Watch the getting-started video up on their site. I have to tell you, that’s pretty impressive stuff. Thank you so much to SublimeSVN and Twilio for sponsoring this week. Let’s get on with the show.

*Music*

Rob: A couple of week back, my comrade, Scott Hanselman, made a crack on the show that struck a nerve with a lot of people. They’re working on really current stuff and they’re super-fired-up. It’s kind of neat, like there’s a, there’s a reason not to become a manager. *Laughter* Oh, yeah. 

Scott: I always hear about people who can’t keep up, because there’s so much. And the more and more layers of abstraction that come in, the more and more people get overwhelmed, and they give up and become a manager (with all due respect to the managers that are listening). 

*Music*

Rob: As with most comments that hit harder than you like, at the time I didn’t think much of it, and neither did Scott; but we’ve received so much feedback, good or bad, saying "that really stuck in my brain, I’m stuck being a manager, and let me tell you, I have an idea for a podcast that’s all about management."And that’s a good idea. I found myself there when I worked at Microsoft, and I was project manager, and as Scott is now, which is funny, that’s the title we both held at Microsoft, and Scott still holds. I was asked to do things like spreadsheets and timelines, requirements gathering and so on. Really not my strength, and for a lot of developers, that’s just a complete nightmare. So what do you do as a developer when you’re asked to manage? You stop writing code, you stop contributing in a tangible way. And you just kind of carry around a clipboard, act important, hold meetings, do phone calls, requirements gathering, agendas, driving people crazy. Developer’s nightmare.

*Music*

## Act 1: Mark Freedman

Mark: I have this constant fantasy that I’m going to be able to go into one of our systems and actually without anybody really questioning it, going in and doing some modifications that I’ve wanted to actually have done to that system but we’ve never had time to schedule. You know, get myself into actually getting to the code again, without, surprise everybody, at the end of the week, I actually updated the system, we can finally deploy this. I made these changes, and I actually feel like I’m doing something useful.

*Music*

Rob: That’s Mark Freedman, one of our listeners who listened to Scott’s comment a couple weeks back, and it resonated with him. He’s been stuck in management for a really long time, and he’s been longing to get back to the code. Showed us a couple of blog posts that he’d wrote, and he and I exchanged a bunch of emails and said, he this is a great topic for a show. You guys should find someone who did xyz, and I said, "Well Mark, why don’t I just talk to you?" Mark was kind enough to share his story with us about being trapped in management.

Mark: The very first feeling that I have as soon as I get out of the elevator doors is a feeling of dread. I mean, the only reason that I’m still there is because I, I love the people that I work with. And the only thing that motivates me, is it’s still, and it’s something I pushed myself also. And even though I might not be crazy about the business I’m in, there’s other people who are spending most of their lives doing this, working for this company. And whatever I do, at least contributes to them. So it’s the only thing that keeps me going. But other than that, since I get in the office I feel dread. OK, I got a list of meetings all day long, another day of wasting away, of not using my mind the way I should be using it. Check my email, check my schedule, it’s going to be another day full of meetings. There’s nothing I’m really going to really accomplish today. Walk out, get my coffee to keep my going, to some kind of, to the next step, then go back to my desk say, and see if I can actually take a look at something interesting. No, I’m already getting pulled in for this problem, this thing that failed, that thing that, you know, that went down. OK, I’m going to have to deal with this up until the next meeting. Maybe I can do something worthwhile this afternoon. 

Rob: It might sound like Mark is just complaining or whining, and he should be grateful to have a job and so on. It’s all too easy to listen to somebody like this and say, "Oh, give me a break." But you know what, you’re going to find yourself in his position in no time, cause really, think about it. If you’re a developer, you’re slinging code, you’re good at it, well what are you going to do next? Have you ever thought about it? What are you going to do next when you become really, really good at what you do? That’s what happened to Mark. He was a great coder, delivered successes time after time, so they thought, "Well hey, let’s make you a manager." Which unfortunately for Mark, meant that he didn’t get to the thing he loved to do, which is code. Also unfortunately for Mark, he happened to be really, really good at his new job. Turns out, he was a pretty good manager.

*Music*

Mark: I do get results. If you ask people who have worked with me, they claim that I’m a good manager. It doesn’t matter. I might be a good manager, I might be able to do that job well, except I feel dead inside by doing it. It’s not really me. Just because I’m good at doing it, it’s not really who I am. I feel that I am not contributing. I might be contributing very strongly in my role, and a lot of people, when I’ve had this conversation with people I’ve worked with, or who work for me, they think I’m crazy when I think this. But I feel like, what value am I really providing? Because I always, I think I’m wasted talent, that my real value was actually implementing these systems myself. And the type of work that I do now, I feel, yeah, I might be good at it, but so many other people can do this that don’t have the same skills that at least I used to have, and I want to get back again.

*Music*

Mark: I like to get my hands in and actually do it. That’s when I feel like I’ve actually accomplished something. Managing a project that might end up being successful, I feel that there’s no special talent of mine that’s helped driving that, at least from inside, from my point of view. And I feel that there’s other people who can do that that might enjoy it and might be better at it than I am. I just feel like I don’t provide as much value that other people might think that I provide, probably because I feel so unhappy doing it, it’s not really who I am.

Rob: I really loved my job at Microsoft, and I kept thinking of it as Mark was telling me his story. And I remember many reviews, and sitting there with my manager, and him saying, "You know Rob, you know at some point you’re going to have to decide which track you’re going to go on, and you can go down the developer’s track, or you can go down the management track, and which is it going to be, do you think?" Because I wrote code, and I also guided projects too, from a management perspective, and they wanted me to pick one. And I just couldn’t do it. And eventually I left the job, and I went and did a couple of my own ventures, and I got to tell you, I feel much more comfortable on my own. And I’d be the first to say it, I really have a hard time working for other people. And the only thing that I dislike more than working for someone else is someone working for me. I’m a horrible manager. And so, I asked Mark, do you think that’s kind of your thing? Do you think you might have this entrepreneurial fire burning inside of you, where you just want to work for yourself, have it be your own deal and no one else’s?

Mark: If I ran the thing myself, if I was on my own, running the thing myself, I would also be, I’d be putting myself in a position where I’d have to do the work. No more employees, nobody else working for me, nobody else that I have to report to. If I want to hire anybody, it’s going to be subcontracting work out to them. I’m trying to structure my next phase of my career where I don’t have to manage anybody ever again. The only thing I have to do is deal with service companies--anything that I need to subcontract any work out. You know, maybe I’m being naive that I’m going to not have to spend so much time managing, but I know that where I am right now I’m not going to have that opportunity being in a purely management role. 

Rob: Mark is not concerned only with himself. He’s trying to help others too. In fact, he’s made it a bit of a cause of his to let developers know that, hey, you know you don’t have to be trapped in this management path. There’s something you can do about it. 

Mark: An issue that I see, several of the people having that I’ve spoken to about this. I see other people that I looked upon as, they are, you know, they have a fabulous career doing exactly what they want to do. They’re moving on to the next company, the next company, and you know, higher-level roles at a technical level. And then I start seeing them, they’re starting to get trapped into management, and I’m warning them, "You are becoming me. I’ve been down this road. You’re starting to feel these feelings. I understand it. You don’t want to get at the point that I’m at right now." So this is not just, this is very common. One of the things I do recommend to other people in this situation, who like me are trying to get back into development after being in management for a few years, is to see if they can initially hook up with people that know what they’re capable of, that they’ve worked with in the past in the role that they want to get back into. They’re going to know what you’re trying to do. They have respect for your capabilities and they’re willing to extend the hand to get you back in the door, to get back in the game again. So that’s what I’m looking at myself, is a couple of opportunities like that, with people who knew me when I’ve worked with them in the past, what I was capable of as a developer. I think that a lot of people are going to be in the same situation, that if they want to get back into development, trying to do it at their current company, it’s going to be a lot more friction trying to do that than if they completely cut ties. It’s just, they’ve already established themselves. They’re already looked upon as management at the company that they’re at. They’re already thought of as that role, and trying to break people’s habits of trying to pull you into that role again is going to be extremely difficult to break.

Rob: I think every job has an aspect that you don’t like. You have duties you don’t like. You have things you’ve got to do that you don’t like. But then it’s a lot different to be the person you don’t want to be, or to be that role you never intended on becoming. You watch your career basically fly off a cliff, and sometimes it just does come right down to it. You just got to leave that job. There’s really no way around it. You try to recast yourself in a new role within a company that’s depended on you a long time is pretty tough. 

Mark: Emotionally, I really had to make a change, but I couldn’t do it because I had this responsibility, this very strong responsibility. It was very risky doing it. I can only get away with threatening it because I go way back with them. It’s only been since my daughter’s been on her own now, that I’ve felt that I can do, what I finally did was give my notice after all these years.

*Music*

Rob: Mark Freedman has a blog where he writes, up at [MarkFreedman.com](http://markfreedman.com/), about his experiences as a manager, and gives you tips about ways to avoid falling into the same trap he did. Many thanks to Mark for his story today. 

*Music*

## Act 2: Bertrand Le Roy

Rob: Now being a manager isn’t negative for everyone. Sometimes people just say, well, I’m going to make the best of this thing. So I figured it would be kind of fun to talk to an old manager of my very own, Bertrand Le Roy. So Scott went up to Redmond last week, and while he was there he sat down with Bertrand. I talked to him also a little bit later, and got his thoughts about being a manager, and what he has decided to do with that title.

Bertrand: You can let the job decide for you, or you can decide what job you want to do. And it depends who you are. If you are a manager, essentially that’s something, that is what you are. That’s great. If you are somebody more technical, if you are a maker, and you need to make things, otherwise you’re going to be a very sad person, then just change the job you’re doing, and make it so that, yeah, you do what you like. Yeah, when you do that, and decide yourself who you are and what you want to do, most of the time you do a better job and you get better reviews, and you get rewarded for that somehow. Or if you don’t then it’s time to move. 

Rob: Bertrand’s title is Project Manager at Microsoft, but he also writes a ton of code. And I know from working with him that one of his favorite things to do is to prototype. And he’ll go home at night, and he’ll think of a neat thing, and prototype it, and bring it back in the morning. But you know, it’s interesting, he works at a place that allows you to basically define your job. You do what you want to do. You’ve got to make sure you’re happy. But his title is also Project Manager, yet he’s managed to strike a balance. But now instead of maintaining one thing that you do, you’ve got to do two things really well. You’ve got to be a coder. You’ve got to be a manager. It can’t be easy. 

Bertrand: Oh yeah, yeah, that of course crossed my mind. Am I going to, you know, do nothing but manage people, and that is a hard job that I’m not sure I want to do, and actually I tried it for a while. I used to be the manager for this guy who was living in Hawaii, you know. 

*Laughter*

Rob: In case you can’t tell, Bertrand is talking about me. I had the privilege of being his first report, the first person that he had to manage. And I think I did a fine job of deterring him from ever wanting to do that again.

*Laughter* 

Bertrand: It had its own challenges, you know. That guy was actually pretty high maintenance. 

Monty Python Frenchman: I fart in your general direction.

*Music*

Bertrand: That was interesting. I had actually two reports, which is not a very large number of reports, but you know, there’s this kind of balance that you have when you have reports between caring too much where basically you take all of their problems on your shoulders, and you carry the weight, you carry your own weight plus the weight of your reports; or you don’t care enough, and then you’re a lousy boss. So, there is this balance to find that is actually very hard to find, and I sense that this time that, yeah, it was drifting into the management world a little too far, and had less and less time to do technical stuff that I’m still very, very much interested in. So yeah, there is this balance to find, and the way I actually came back to being an individual contributor, and doing some more technical stuff, is by just doing it. 

Rob: That was one of the bits of advice that Bertrand gave me when I first started working for him, and I found myself doing things like requirements and budgets and scopes and so on. And I’m not very good at that, and I flat-out told him that this isn’t my strong suit. He’s like, "All right, don’t do it. If you don’t want to do these things, don’t do it. We’ll figure it out." Good bit of advice, not so easy when you work at a company that really just doesn’t allow you to do lateral movement. But then, there’s a lot to be said for someone just doing something. If you’re that valuable and you’re that needed, and they can’t do without you, well, then you can make your own space, can’t you? Bertrand did. He kind of had to. Management really just isn’t his thing. He’s got a Ph.D. in physics, of all things, and now he’s a project manager. How does that work?

Bertrand: I was more of a theoretical kind of physicist. So, I was actually building formulas more than I was tinkering with actual experimental physics. But it was the same kind of creative process. I mean, when you’re after an equation or a model for something, you are, it’s actually a creative process that is very much like software development.

Rob: I can sort of see that, but not really. How do you go from being Ph.D. Physics Guy to writing software?

Bertrand: Well, there was a transition period and actually, people who start in physics today are going to have a very hard time finding a good job. And while that’s actually nothing new, it’s been going on for a few decades, basically after you’ve written your Ph.D. thesis, you usually spend between ten and fifteen years doing post-doc, which are relatively low-pay jobs that are usually very far from home, and where you try to publish as many papers as you can. You know, it’s really, really hard. I have lots of admiration for my friends who actually stayed in that business. It’s really hard to become a researcher today. And I guess I didn’t have the persistence to do that. I had another line of work that I could do, which was software development. And at that point, it was very easy to find a job. The jobs were really well paid, and you know, I’m just human. So I went for that, and actually I love that sort of job, so that was good. 

*Music*

## Act 3: Todd Baesen

Rob: Making the transition from a scientific field to software development, I guess, is not that uncommon. In fact, I used to be a geologist myself, and transitioned into being a geek, running databases, and so on. In fact, it’s how I met my buddy, Todd, who is our third story teller. We both worked together at an environment company, neither of us doing then what we do now. But how do you go from a scientific field to something completely different like software development, and then into project management?

Todd: I spent about five years doing software development and architecture in a small web shop in France, and I built some kind of content management system there. And that was, I think, interesting in a few ways; and that helped me getting hired by Microsoft. So I actually sent my resume to somebody I knew at Microsoft, and you know it went around. I had some interviews, and then I just moved across the ocean and came here at Microsoft and starting being a developer here. And I did that for, how long, about six years? Something like that, yeah, something like that. And then, the program manager I was working with at the time went on vacation, and he asked me to do his job in addition to my job; and so I happened to do his job for a couple of weeks, and I liked it. And I was also doing some stuff in community management, stuff like that, that I was doing on the side as well, you know, just because I love that kind of work. And from that, well, he asked me if I wanted to do that full-time, and I said, "yeah."

Rob: Now it makes sense. Being a manager is challenging, and when you’re a developer, and you start to go into management, the very facets of being a manager turn into challenge, and you face them and deal with them just like you would with any other coding problem. You solve them, and if you find out that you’re good, well hey guess what? You get to do it again, and again, and again. Us software developers, by definition, we’re a creative bunch. That’s what we do. We create stuff, and it’s intoxicating. You get to release it, and share it with the world. And as a manager, it’s kind of the opposite. You can still be creative if you want to, but management tasks mean that you pretty much have to refine and refine what you do over and over, make it better and more efficient, and you have to impose that on your team. As a creative person, that can suck the soul right out of you, make you hate your job, sort of like Mark was hating his job. But how do you keep creative? How do you keep inspired?

*Music*

Todd: Yeah, that’s very important. That’s the important part, I think. Doing something new but not necessarily a new form of what you were doing before. But if you become a manager by default because you’re worn out or, I don’t know, maybe you haven’t looked hard enough, I don’t know if creative people ever stop being creative. I actually have never seen that. Have you?

Rob: No, I haven’t. Not really.

Todd: That doesn’t happen.

Rob: I think people get bored.

Todd: I think it’s a poor excuse. I don’t know. Oh, actually, yesterday I was talking to a friend who was in a phase where he’s never had something like that before. He has always been someone who knew what he what he wanted to do, and currently he doesn’t really know, and he’s a very creative person. And I don’t expect that to last very long. I think he’ll find something. He’s just in that process of finding what he wants to do next. I also have a very good friend who used to be an engineer like me, and we were working together, actually, in France. And one day he just said, "Well, I don’t want to do that anymore, and I’m quitting, and now I’m doing music full-time." And that was a very brave thing to do, because he had no connections in music. Well, it was just—there was no reason to believe that he would succeed, but he did. He actually became pretty well known in France. He’s a recognized musician, and he’s successful in that business. But, you know. So let me rephrase what I said earlier. Doing that by default is maybe not a poor excuse, because it’s not easy to be brave enough to take that sort of leap of faith that you can do something else. And I guess that for someone like me, it’s so easy to have fun doing something technical, that—you see what I mean? That transition is not as radical as what that guy has been doing.  I think there is a limit to what is due to your merit, and that limit is where luck begins, and I consider myself a very lucky person. I’ve had the fortune, the good fortune, to always do pretty much what I wanted to do, and I’m well aware that I’m very privileged in that, and that most people don’t have that sort of choice. And, you know, it’s easy to say, well, do some open-source projects at night, and eventually you’ll get recognized for your work, and maybe you can get hired to do that stuff full-time. Yeah, sure, that can happen, but it probably can’t happen to everyone, and there is a fair amount of luck involved in that, also. Yeah, it’s not easy. As for technical excuses, having to do with what your job description is about, you don’t stop doing what you’re paid for and just do whatever you want. First you do what you’re paid for, and here and there you go through the cracks and, well, if there is this opportunity to build a prototype, you build that prototype. You build that reputation and that image about you, where you are, and two things can happen. People can accept it and actually recognize you for who you are, or they can actually not like that. And in that case maybe it’s time to move. I don’t know. It’s an easy thing to say, of course.

*Music*

Rob: It is an easy thing to say, especially when you have done it. Many thanks to Bertrand Le Roy for his thoughts today. And for those of you wondering, I unduly pick on Bertrand whenever I can. You can read more about Bertrand and his musings on life at http://weblogs.asp.net/bleroy, b-l-e-r-o-y.

*Music*

Rob: Well, if you haven’t noticed, we’ve been missing something this week. It’s my compatriot, Mr. Hanselman. He is traveling, so he is not able to participate as much as he wants, although he did do an interview with Bertrand. And I’ve got a clip of it I’d love to share with you. It’s a great story, and it’s actually a story that Scott told about coming up against a manager who’s retained his technical chops. Here, I’ll let him tell the story—it’s great.

Scott: Last time I came up to Microsoft, I wrote this little mobile viewEngine thing. I spent like 7 hours writing code straight, and I think I ended up with, like, 94 lines of code in like 7 hours; but it was the most satisfying 7 hours that I’ve had in weeks. It’s funny, because while I was writing this thing, I started out with--it started with 50 lines of broken code. It was broken, and it wasn’t broken as in "there’s a bug, fix one line." It was broken in a "this is fundamentally wrong, and it needs to be rewritten," like it was a dead-end street, a one-way dead end. I had coded myself into a corner, so I said, "All right, I’m going to take this chunk of crap, I’m going to put it over here on the wall, and I’m going to look at it," and then I started writing from scratch. And then I wrote like 200 lines, and I got it to work. And I think I iterated in that 7 hours 5 times. And I showed it to 3 or 4 people. I’m not sure if I showed it to you. I showed it to Phil, I showed it to Dmitri, talked to you, and we kind of refactored it and sculpted it, and then suddenly it was the tightest possible 50-odd lines that it could be.

Bertrand: Yeah, you got different suggestions from everyone.

Scott: Totally different, and it was so much better than my first one, and my fifth one, and my, you know what I mean. And it was so satisfying. Can you get that kind of satisfaction from managing people?

Bertrand: Yeah, well, the difference between managing people and doing stuff is, is that instead of doing stuff you are enabling other people to do stuff. Sometimes it’s—you know—making sure that they don’t have the distractions, so that you’re facilitating in that way, and you’re also facilitating through conversation, and brainstorming and . . . yeah, I [unintelligible], and five people are more intelligent than five people--together, five people together are more intelligent that five people on their own.

Scott: While I was writing this code, I was cursing Anders Hejlsberg, the inventor.

Bertrand: We do that a lot.

Scott: The inventor of C#. I was saying, "Dammit, Anders! If only you had designed it this way. Dammit Anders!" And it became a joke over the course of the day. Here I am, coding for the first time in a week, my sad little 50 lines of code, and I’m trying to get it just right, and I’m sculpting. And then Dmitri comes in, and I’m not sure how much higher he is than I am in the company. It’s four or five levels up, and over to the corner, so he’s like my great-great-uncle in an organizational sense. And he comes over, and Dmitri is this amazing—is he from the Ukraine, or Russia?

Bertrand: I don’t exactly, somewhere from Russia . . .

Scott: Somewhere, but when I do his accent it’ll be clear. But he comes over, and he looks at the code for like three minutes, completely and instantly absorbs what it’s doing, makes two suggestions that make the code ten times better, and then looks me straight in the face, and says, "Don’t blame Anders for your bad design," *Music* and then walks away. And if was just like, like if this was like a rap battle, he would have like dropped the microphone and just walked offstage.

*Music*

Scott: It was epic, and it was like "Wow, don’t underestimate your manager."

Bertrand: I don’t know, I think cursing is very useful in a developer’s job.

Scott: Yeah?

Bertrand: Yeah, you need to curse at specific people and blame them for all your faults, actually. I disagree with Dmitri. You were wrong, of course, but I think you were right in focusing your anger on somebody. See what I mean? It gives you direction. It gives you focus.

Scott: But I *was wrong, of course.*

*Music*

Rob: Scott will be joining us once again next week. I missed him for this show.

*Music*

Rob: Project management doesn’t need to be something that you dread and fear. In fact, I have a really good friend,Todd Baesen, whom I’ve known for a very, very long time. And he has established himself in a pretty good career being a project manager. He started out as a chemical engineer in the environmental consulting industry. In fact, that’s where he and I worked together a long, long time ago. And he climbed his way up the management chain, and found that he really, really enjoyed it. Next thing he knows, he’s sitting on top of multi-million-dollar budgets, one of the big refineries in the San Francisco Bay area. But Todd has always been kind of a geek, very scientifically minded, as I mentioned he graduated with a degree in chemical engineering, went on to the Navy, and scored so high in his placement exam that the Navy gave him the pick of duties that he could do. So he ended up picking nuclear engineer on the Enterprise, the flagship aircraft carrier of the entire United States naval fleet. It’s a pretty prestigious position. You gotta be pretty darn smart to get there. And now, many years later, Todd finds himself as a project manager. So we talked the other day, and I asked him straight up, "How in the hell did you get here?"

Todd: Well, I had always been interested in the science and the engineering part, I think. You know, most people who take the time to study that in school enjoy that, the technical stimulation and then the challenges of that. But if you’re not a complete idiot, if you are reasonably articulate, and can deal with people, you know at some point you’re successful to a point in the technical aspects, and there’s sort of a pressure to become a manager. It seems, you know, I think the non-technical folks, the ones you know you don’t want to put in front of clients or running a group of people. So for me that became real obvious about six or seven years in, that that was the road I was heading down. And first I resisted a little bit, I’d say, because you know what you know. You’re getting very good at the technical parts. But at some point I considered it its own set of challenges. Here’s a whole new discipline that I hadn’t studied, and I wasn’t good at, and getting to understand even simple things like scheduling software and budgeting, and understanding some of these financial metrics that they’re looking at, and all of that. It seemed exciting, and then working with the team, and leading a group of folks, there’s a little bit of ego in that, in terms of being a leader, and seeing if you have what it takes to be a leader, which is kind of a different set of skills.

Rob: This has always fascinated me when it comes to project management. You know, you can have a project manager who fancies himself the leader of the team and kind of dictates over everybody what to do and when to do it, or you can have someone who’s a little bit more reserved, who plays more of a facilitator’s role. That’s what I asked Todd. Were you a leader? Were you the alpha dog?

Todd: Well, I did see myself as the leader. I saw myself as the person who would sort of set the vision. I was quite often involved in most of my projects right up front in proposal development stages and in some of the initial scoping. I think once the project was together and we began to get into, you know, in our case architecture and design and some of these other things, the technical team took the lead. And I felt like that changed, like my role was more or less, I was the cat herder, you know, the cats were running around going crazy and it was my job to keep them going down the road that they said they wanted to go on for the project. And so, I felt like, eventually as a project would go further and further along, my role would evolve into support. I mean, I knew I was in charge, and I knew I was making the final calls and decisions on things, but I really felt like my job was to support the project. When my technical folks didn’t have what they need, it was my job to go arm wrestle senior management and get it for them. So, it’s sort of the old Microsoft model, the inverted pyramid, where I felt like I supported the larger group. And it worked well that way, I thought. And at some point, that keeps you from maybe getting too much ego in your role too, so that seemed helpful.

Rob: I remember watching a Star Trek episode a long time ago, not any of the new ones. It was the old, classic one. It was the one where Kirk had his evil taken out of him. He turned into a wimp. He was no longer able to command the Enterprise effectively. It takes sharp teeth to be the alpha dog. You mix sharp teeth with a pretty keen intellect, and someone who likes to be the alpha dog, well you got a pretty good manager. Todd knows how to use that to his advantage.

Todd: Well, I think there’s the part, if we’re going back again talking about ego, there was the flush of victory. We had gone on to this very challenging project site with nothing. It was literally me walking in the door, and over the period of the next year had hired fifteen new staff, started a new office, taken over a lot of projects that weren’t going so well, had shown significant improvements not only technically but significantly reduced the cost of doing the work. And so, you know, the typical day involved me, you know I’d sort of alluded to the herding cats part, with all of these many, many subprojects going on, very busy, lots of people in and out of my office. Three, four phone calls a day. Four, five meetings a day. And so, it was a part of that that was a kind of a buzz and energy. When everything was going well, there were occasionally fires to put out. It’s not like everything is going well. But when the overall sense of what’s going on in the project is exciting, and you’re moving, and there’s a lot of success and accolades, you know, it’s very seductive. It’s, it’s—you realize you’re good at this thing, and it makes for a very positive work experience. Of course, those very same types of things are under a black cloud if things aren’t going so well. You know, the satisfaction level is very different, but I tend to put a lot of myself into my work. I think that anyone that spends nine, ten, or more hours a day on the job, you’re a fool if you don’t have a lot of yourself in it, because you’re spending most of your day outside of your head and outside of your body, or whatever. So me, I brought all that to the table. So when the project is doing well, by default I’m doing well. So there’s quite a personal rush in that. I can remember, you know, during this period getting several phone calls. And at first they were phone calls from the clients, saying, you’re doing a rocking job, and then from my management, saying we heard you’re doing a rocking job, and then from a bunch of people in senior management in both of the companies, saying you guys are doing such a good job we want to turn you into the model, and we want you to tell us what you’re doing, and you’re the best in class, and we’d like you to put this on paper how we do this, and we want to do this around the country. And these types of things are, you know, that’s what you’re in business for, right, for me? Of course you’re there for the money, but I’m not getting rich in this business, and so you’re there for those moments and those accolades, and so that was great. You know, you come home juiced from work every night, and ready to go to work the next day.

Rob: Todd’s the guy that likes to make things and build things, much like a software developer. We like to create. But there’s another part of him that we all have, which is gratified by doing a really good job by facilitating and moving a project forward. It kind of strokes your ego. You can take responsibility for it and say I did that. All of us have a creative side, the little artist that lives in our brain, balanced with the businessman, the more stoic, pragmatic aspect. The question is, which voice do you let get louder? Which voice do you let dictate your career? For Todd, he very much enjoyed the management side. For Mark, well, he’s a little bit more creative.

Todd: You know, what you described about technical folks and their views of managers, I can’t say I didn’t have that view myself coming up through the ranks, that managers were a bunch of idiots, and of course just like anywhere in the world there’s a certain number of them that are, and there’s a certain number of ones that are really competent and know their job, and they know when to sort of inject themselves in the projects and when to get the hell out of the way and let the talented people to do their work. I know that in the engineering realms, of course, I was very good at engineering, and so I would maybe insert myself a little heavier into those projects, and maybe when I was doing IT work I was more like, No, I’m just going to be here to help you guys schedule, budget, and stay on track. And I don’t really know that much about what you guys are doing. I need to know enough to know when I need to inject myself and find out more, and so that was a different sort of premise, I guess. It wasn’t as much of a struggle as you’d think, as you say that the ego says, oh, this means that they value my skill set, and therefore this is a sort of logical development. And so I think I went into that without a lot of struggle. I think the struggle came later.

Todd: As I actually got there and realized I was doing very well, and began to climb the management chain, and then maybe found myself with a little bit more sort of self-loathing. I had achieved it. My ego said, I can do this thing, in fact I got very successful at it, and then as I’m looking at the engineering in the tail lights moving away, I was kind of like, there goes that thing that I really loved, and do I love this thing more? Maybe not. I’ve enjoyed certain aspects of it, but what’s the price been for that?

Rob:  When people moan and groan about being a manager, most of the time they’re talking about having to deal with conference calls and meetings and endless group emails, and your calendar pinging at you constantly that you’ve got to be doing something else, anything other than what you really want to be doing. As Bertrand pointed out earlier, when you start managing others, that’s when it gets tricky. Sometimes you like it. Sometimes the human contact can fire you up, make you feel like you’re contributing to someone else’s career. Other times, we end up with someone like Mark, our first story teller, who just doesn’t want to do the job. So I asked Todd, I said, "You know what do you do when you have an employee that is going down a track. Let’s say they want to be a manager. Let’s say they’re a manager under you, and they don’t want to do it. What do you tell them?"

Todd: Yeah, this has happened to me on more than one occasion. I always take two swings at the plate with the person and really push them hard, because if I think they’re a good manager, then I think it’s really natural to doubt that as you’re looking in their rear-view mirror. So I’ll usually push them, and say, you know you’re really good at this, you’ve got a big future here, and I’ll paint the picture of what happens if they go back to it. And I’m not claiming I know that they’ll be happy or not. They may be, but there’s a limit on the technical-track folks in engineering, and they’re inevitably going to make less money, and keep doing the same thing that they’re doing. They’ll go from project to project doing what they do, and doing what they do well. And will that excite them ten years down the line? Is that really where they want to go? So I’ll usually push them a little bit, and remind them about some of those things. You know, if they really don’t want to be a manager, then I’ll let them out with blessings and find a role for them, because talented folks, I don’t want to lose them. I don’t care if they don’t do what I wish they would do. You know, you don’t want to lose talented folks. So I push pretty hard, and I’ve kept some people I think on a track that probably is going to make them happier in the long run because they had some of that experience.

Rob: Indeed, I have worked with Todd and number of times, and he’s a pretty capable manager—inspires people, pushes them, and gets them to do things that maybe they want to do, maybe that don’t. That’s what a good manager does. I mean, sometimes they have to get inside your head, make you feel better about what it is you’re doing, where it is you’re going, or sometimes they just show you the door. And it’s at this point that the conversation got rather interesting. It turns out that Todd is changing his career. Now I’ve known about this for a while, so I asked him, what’s behind this change? Is it because the track in front of you is a manager’s manager, the guy that sits in the corner office? Is it something that really appeals to you?

Todd: So I’ve made a decision about that. I turned down my next logical management promotion and I think I decided I’m going to move into another field, find something that I’d enjoy doing more too. I think there’s two elements: one, of course you like it more when things are doing well, but—you know me—when adversity comes, I’m the kind of person that will push back harder than I’m being pushed on, so that’s not the part that broke me inevitably for this career. I think for me, what happened is that despite some of the adversity, I still was continuing to grow the management track, as it were, and I felt like I was getting—the more successful I got, the farther and farther I was getting away from several other things that I like, not just the technical side. As you go up in management, eventually you even start moving away from the people. You’re no longer just managing projects, where you’re with a team of--whatever, three, four, five, ten people that you get to work with every day. And I was describing that buzz and energy about people coming in and out of my office. Well, eventually you get to the point where you’re managing divisions and offices from afar, and you get further and further from human contact. So for me, when I’m losing the human contact, I’m losing the technical aspects, and all I’m left with really are these long-distance phone calls, and bean counting, and number crunching, and all of that. That was my limit. I realized that I don’t enjoy this. I think the last connection to me was the human part. And so, thus my career change really to medicine. I have this field ahead of me where every bit is intellectually and scientifically stimulating, but each and every day there’ll be many, many people coming to me, and you know, for one-on-one interactions and that kind of human contact that I think is important for me.
